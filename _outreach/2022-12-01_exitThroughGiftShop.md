title: "Exit through the microscopic gift shop"
excerpt: "I wrote an outreach article about the results of my dijet azimuthal asymmetry study that was published as a CMS physics briefing on December 2022."
collection: outreach

The CMS collaboration encourages us researchers to promote the newly published results by releasing a physics briefing, where the main results of the analysis are summarized in an article that is aimed to be understandable with the basis of high school physics. In the article I wrote about my dijet azimuthal asymmetry analysis, I describe the path-length dependent energy loss in quark-gluon plasma with the help of exiting a musem through the gift shop. Why would these events be related? [Read my article](https://cms.cern/news/exit-through-microscopic-gift-shop) to find out!
