title: "Jetting through a droplet of matter from the early universe"
excerpt: "I wrote an outreach article about the results of my dijet jet shape study that was published as a CMS physics briefing on March 2021."
collection: outreach

The CMS collaboration encourages us researchers to promote the newly published results by releasing a physics briefing, where the main results of the analysis are summarized in an article that is aimed to be understandable with the basis of high school physics. In this article I discuss energy gets converted into matter, and how highly energetic streams of particles shoot through a matter as it was just after the Big Bang in the early universe. Want to find out more? <a href="https://cms.cern/news/jetting-through-droplet-matter-early-universe">Read my article</a> and see how these interactions are studied!
