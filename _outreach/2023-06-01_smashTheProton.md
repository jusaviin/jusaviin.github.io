<a href="https://www.raghavke.me">Professor Raghav Kunnawalkam Elayavalli</a> lead this four day workshop for the high school students. The worshop began with a short introduction to today's topic by Raghav, after which the students simulated particle collisions with Pythia8 and analyzed their generated data. I was walking around the classroom advising the students and answering any questions they might have about the practicalities or interpretation of the results.
