excerpt: "I wrote an outreach article about the results of my energy-energy correlator study in PbPb collisions that was published as a CMS physics briefing on July 2024."
collection: outreach

The CMS collaboration encourages us researchers to promote the newly published results by releasing a physics briefing, where the main results of the analysis are summarized in an article that is aimed to be understandable with the basis of high school physics. I did the first study ever published on energy-energy correlators in heavy ion collisions. Many people believed this would be impossible due to large background, but I made it work with the support of the CMS heavy ion and Vanderbilt research groups! One of the main physics goals of this study is to identify a resolution scale for gluon emissions that quark-gluon plasma can distinguish. There are similarities here with the resolution scale on your eyes, and how well you can see things. What is this connection? [Read my article](https://cms.cern/news/quantum-optician) to find out!
