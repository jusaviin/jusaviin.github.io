I recreated the Large Hadron Collider in Super Mario Maker 2, where is it called the Large Koopa Collider. You can find an overview of the level in [Wizulus's SMM2 Viewer](https://smm2.wizul.us/smm2/level/KBM-49D-GSF). If you own the game, you can find this level with the code KBM-49D-GSF. It is technically difficult to make a large collider within the game, which is why this representation is more of a fixed target experiment. The control room is modeled after the ALICE experiment. From there you need to go though the security, and take an elevator down to the tunnel. Down the tunnel you will find your personal protective equipment in question mark blocks. In the tunnel, you will first need to insert a koopa to a linear accelerator, from which it is directed to a circular accelerator. The smaller circular accelerator steers the koopa shell to a larger circular accelerator, where you need to collide it with another koopa to collect data (represented by a key). After this, you can return back to the surface with an elevator and beat the level.
