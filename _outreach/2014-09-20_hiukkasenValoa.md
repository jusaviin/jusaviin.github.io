The city of Jyväskylä has a yearly event called Valon Kaupunki (City of Light), where a lot of different light exhibitions are presented. In 2014, the University of Jyväskylä joined to event with their Hiukkasen valoa (Particle's light) event. Part of the Hiukkasen valoa event was a mobile LHC tunnel exhibition, that had two different exhibition modes, both working using motion detection cameras. In the first mode, users could kick protons to collide with other protons, and depending on the speed of the collision, different amount of particles is created in the collision. The second mode illustrated the effect of Higgs' field by slowing down the movement (creating mass) on the side of the screen where the Higgs' field was active compared to the side where there were no Higgs' field. I was presenting this exhibition to the general public during the event. The image below shows another physicist, <a href="http://users.jyu.fi/~hejajama/">Heikki Mäntysaari</a>, who was presenting the exhibition with me, demonstrating the Higgs' field mode of the mobile LHC echibition. The one below that shows the setup for colliding protons.
