Energy-energy correlators have recently gained importance as experimental observables that have predicted sensitivities to a multitude of perturbative and non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics phenomena in high-energy collisions. Using data recorded by the CMS detector, energy-energy correlators are measured in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions for the first time. The data are obtained at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV with an integrated luminosity of \\(1.70\,\mathrm{nb}^{-1}\\). Energy-energy correlators are constructed by taking a weighted average of the separation of particle pairs \\((\Delta r)\\) within a given  jet cone of inclusive jets with transverse momenta between 120 and 200 GeV. A similar analysis is done for proton-proton (pp) collisions at the same center-of-mass energy to obtain a reference. The ratio of PbPb to pp energy-energy correlators reveals a \\(\Delta r\\) dependence that can be related to properties of the medium created in heavy ion collisions.
