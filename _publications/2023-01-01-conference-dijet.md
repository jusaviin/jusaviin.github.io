Jet quenching is a well-established signature of quark–gluon plasma formation in heavy-ion collisions. Studies of the transverse momentum balance of back-to-back jets, as well as medium-induced modifications to jet shapes and fragmentation functions, provide important experimental constraints on quark–gluon plasma properties. Using a large sample of dijet events from 5.02 TeV lead–lead and proton–proton collisions recorded by the CMS, we study quenching effects differentially with respect to the dijet transverse momentum balance. We use short-range correlations between jets and charged particles to assess medium-induced modifications to jet substructures on each side of the dijet. The path-length-dependent energy loss and energy density fluctuations are also probed using long-range correlations between jets and charged particles.
