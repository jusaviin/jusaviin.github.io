Modifications to the distribution of charged particles with respect to high transverse momentum \\((p_{\mathrm{T}})\\) jets passing through a quark-gluon plasma are explored using the CMS detector. Back-to-back dijets are analyzed in lead-lead and proton-proton collisions at \\(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}= 5.02\)) TeV via correlations of charged particles in bins of relative pseudorapidity and angular distance from the leading and subleading jet axes. In comparing the lead-lead and proton-proton collision results, modifications to the charged-particle relative distance distribution and to the momentum distributions around the jet axis are found to depend on the dijet momentum balance \\(x_{j}\\), which is the ratio between the subleading and leading jet \\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\). For events with \\(x_{j} \approx 1\\), these modifications are observed for both the leading and subleading jets. However, while subleading jets show significant modifications for events with a larger dijet momentum imbalance, much smaller modifications are found for the leading jets in these events.
