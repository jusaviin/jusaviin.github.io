CMS has performed a wide range of jet measurements in heavy-ion collisions. A selection of newest results in this field is presented. New results of the nuclear modification factor \\(R_{\mathrm{AA}}\\) from XeXe collisions are compared to the previous results from PbPb collisions to study system size dependence of the energy loss. Energy loss in PbPb collisions is studied more differentially by measuring radial momentum distributions with inclusive jets. The dependence of parton flavor to energy loss is studied with photon-tagged jet shapes and by correlating tracks from reconstructed \\(D^{0}\\) particles to the jet axis. Finally groomed jet substructure results for shared momentum fraction \\(z_{g}\\) and jet mass \\(M_{g}\\) are presented to go deeper into the details of energy loss mechanisms.
