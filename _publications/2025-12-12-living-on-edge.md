Jet substructure observables serve as essential tools for probing the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their interpretation, however, is often complicated by edge effects, which arise when correlated particles fall outside the reconstructed jet radius, introducing distortions that obscure the underlying QCD dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive phenomenological study of edge effects in soft-insensitive angular observables, taking the two-point energy correlator (EEC) as a representative example. We argue that these distortions scale linearly with the average angular separation between the winner-take-all and E-scheme axes ⟨ϕ⟩, and validate this behavior across proton-proton (p-p) simulations with Pythia8 and Herwig7, as well as lead-lead (Pb-Pb) simulations using JEWEL and CoLBT. In p-p collisions, edge effects are strongly suppressed, scaling as \\((R_{L}/R)^{4}\\), whereas medium-modified jets can exhibit larger distortions, with contributions scaling as \\((R_{L}/R)^{2}\\) and \\((R_{L}/R)^{4}\\). Taking Pb-Pb/p-p ratios of the EEC substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, these distortions, highlighting the need of accounting for edge effects in the interpretation of heavy-ion jet substructure measurements. Since edge effects are largely governed by the ⟨ϕ⟩ distribution, studying this distribution provides a new handle for benchmarking and constraining the modeling of edge effects in heavy-ion event generators.
