Energy-energy correlator has the advantage of isolating physics of different angular scales, which has attracted a lot of interest recently to study this correlator in heavy-ion environments. Any modification from proton-proton reference can reveal hints about the inner workings of the quark-gluon plasma. In this presentation we will present the first measurement of the energy-energy correlator of jets in heavy ion collisions using lead-lead data at 5.02 TeV collected by CMS. We observe significant modifications over the pp reference and discuss the implications of these observations, along with future directions.
