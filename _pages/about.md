I am originally from Hankasalmi, a small rural town of less than 6000 inhabitants in Central Finland. After finishing high school, I moved to Jyväskylä to study physics at the University of Jyväskylä. During my undergrad I was an exchange student in Regina, Saskatchewan for one semester. Towards the end of my undergraduate studies, I ended up working with the ALICE group doing experimental heavy ion physics. I continued in the ALICE group to work towards a PhD. The first half of my PhD studies I was located in Jyväskylä, but the second half I was stationed in CERN to be able to take more closer part in the everyday running of the experiment. I got my PhD on 2017 and got my first postdoctoral researched position from University of Illinois at Chicago. At the same time I also changed experiments from ALICE to CMS. After working 3.5 years in Chicago, I moved to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee togerher with my beautiful wife [Emily](https://ziliak.com/our-people/attorneys/emily-hayes/). On November 2024, our family grew as Elizabeth, who is the cutest baby ever, was born. I currently work at the Vanderbilt University as a postdoctoral researcher.

Heavy ion physics and jets
======
In heavy ion physics we collide heavy ions in order to create quark-gluon plasma, en exotic state of matter that filled the universe a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Quarks are the building pieces that combine to create protons, neutrons and many other particles. Gluons carry the interactions between quarks. In regular matter, quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong interaction, dictates that quarks always either in pairs or sets of three. Quark-gluon plasma is a special state of matter since within this state quarks can move freely, without being confined into the states where they normally reside. I am especially interested in collimated streams of particles, called jets, that are sometimes created in particle collisions. The particles in these jets interact with quark-gluon plasma, and when they are measured in a detector their properties are modified when compared to collisions where no quark-gluon plasma is created. The details of these modifications carry information about the properties of the quark-gluon plasma.


Free time
======
I find adequate amount of free time very important to balance the time spent on research. I like doing all kinds of sports. I have played football (for the Americans there, in this football the ball is actually kicked with your feet) in the fifth highest league stage in Finland, in addition to many different recreational leagues. I have also played volleyball at recreational league level. I used to be in a circus school in Jyväskylä, where I did juggling, floor acrobatics, aerial silks and pair acrobatics. At times, I have also praticed martial arts (Han Moo Do and Taekwondo), tennis, floorball, running, swimming, biking, cross country skiing, disc golf, slack line, orienteering and trampoline acrobatics.

I enjoy being in the nature doing camping and hiking. In Finland I have done these escpecially in the Hossa National Park in the north, which has really beutiful forests. When stationed in CERN, I used to often do day hikes in the Jura or the Alps. In the United States I have visited several state and notinal parks for day and overnight hikes, including Indiana Dunes, Starved Rock, Smoky Mountains, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Grand Canyon and Virgin Falls.

I also really like playing board games. I own tens of games and have played hundreds of different ones. I really like the problem solving aspect in many heavier board games, where you will need to make the best decisions within the available options. Even though heavy strategy games are my favorites, I enjoy any kind of games and lighter social ones are great ice breakers for evenings with friends.
